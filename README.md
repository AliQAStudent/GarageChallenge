# What is this

This is my repository for the garage challenge

# How to run

This is a console application. Just run in the terminal.

# What does it do

It creates a garage, adds 3 cars, 3 bikes, 3 trucks. Then if fixes them and calculates each vehicle's bill. Lastly, it clears the garage and outputs the total earnings

# What does it output

Note: The Garage class automatically prevents new vehicles with ids that already exist from being added. In that case, it auto-increments the new vehicle's id as shown below

```
